# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- rigid2d - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- frame_main - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input

# Conceptual Questions
1. We need to be able to ~normalize~ Vector2D objects (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of a given Vector2D):
   - Propose three different designs for implementing the ~normalize~ functionality

   - Discuss the pros and cons of each proposed method, in light of the C++ Core Guidelines.

   - Which of the methods would you implement and why?

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?


3. Why is Vector2D a struct and Transform2D Class (refer to at least 2 specific C++ core guidelines in your answer)?


4. Why are some of the constructors in Transform2D explicit (refer to a specific C++ core guideline in your answer)?


5. Why is Transform2D::inv() declared const while Transform2D::operator*=() is not?

# Sample Run of frame_main

Enter transform T_{a,b}:
deg: 90 x: 0 y: 1

Enter transform T_{b,c}:
deg: 90 x: 1 y: 0

T_{a,b}: deg: 90 x: 0 y: 1
T_{b,a}: deg: -90 x: -1 y: -6.12323e-17
T_{b,c}: deg: 90 x: 1 y: 0
T_{c,b}: deg: -90 x: -6.12323e-17 y: 1
T_{a,c}: deg: 180 x: 6.12323e-17 y: 2
T_{c,a}: deg: -180 x: -1.83697e-16 y: 2

Enter vector v_b:
1 1 

v_bhat:[0.707107, 0.707107]
v_a:[-1, 2]
v_b:[1, 1]
v_c:[1, 1.11022e-16]

Enter Twist V_b:
1 1 1

V_a:[1, 0, 1]
V_b:[1, 1, 1]
V_c:[1, 2, -1]
